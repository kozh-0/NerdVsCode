# Java (Spring Boot) and React basic showcase

This is a quick starter for projects using Spring Boot as backend and React as frontend.

You find a detailed description in this post:
https://marco.dev/deploy-java-react-one


To the basic example I added some 'showcases' extra features:
- Test with MockMvc
- Test with RestTemplateTest
- OpenApi using Spring Doc (code first). Swagger-ui is accessible here: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui

The goal is to provide a small application with a full set of features well documented that can be used as inspiration or reference for other projects.

Non-goal are to provide a full set of features or a template to be used to build other applications (well, you could do it but there is a lot to delete).

## Request a feature
You can contact me or fill a feature request if you would like to see a feature included in this showcase.
